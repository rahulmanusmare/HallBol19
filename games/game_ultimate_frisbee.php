                <h3>Team Formation Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total number of players in a team = 6.</li>
                    <li>There should be players from minimum three batches.</li>
                    <li>MTech, Phd and Faculty will be considered different batches.</li>

		<h3>Game Rules</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Starting the Game: </b></li>
		       <ul>
			   <li>A coin toss allots the two teams as offense (in possession of the disc) and defense (not in possession of the disc).</li>
			   <li>Players from both teams take positions on the D-lines of their respective goals.</li>
			   <li>Initially the defense has the possession of the frisbee.</li>
			   <li>The defense throws the frisbee to the offense and the game starts.</li>
			   <li>When the defense score, the defense becomes the offense team and sides switch.</li>
			    </ul>
		 <li><b>Passing:</b></li>
		        <ul>
				<li>On the first throw of the game or on a throw after any goal scored, a defense player cannot possess the frisbee on first flight. Even if the frisbee touches the ground, offense gets the first possession.</li>
				<li>Disc can be passed in any direction.</li>
				<li>If the disc goes beyond the borders on the field, it is considered an outside and the possession switches.</li>
				<li>If a player drops the disc, the possession switches</li>
				<li>A defense player has to maintain a minimum distance of 1 arms length from the offense player in possession of the disc. If not so, will be considered as a foul.</li>
				<li>Offense player is not allowed to run from the position where he/she caught it with the disc still in hand. If so, will be counted as a foul.</li>
				<li>Offense player has only 10 seconds to throw the disc. If not so, will be counted as a foul.</li>
				<li>If a defense player taps the disc while it is in flight, the possession switches, defense becomes offense and vice-versa.</li>
				<li>If a defense player taps the disc while it is in the hands of an offense player, it is counted as a foul.</li>
				<li>In case of any of the fouls mentioned above, the possession switches immediately to the opposite team.<li>
				<li>If a player does 3 fouls, he is out of the game for the whole 30 minutes</li>
				
				</ul>
			<li><b></b></li>
