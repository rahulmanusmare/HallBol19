                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <ul>
				    <li>Keeping in mind that everyone should get a chance to bat, no batsman will be allowed to play more than 5 continuous balls (without rotating a strike), batsman doing so will be declared "Retired Hurt", which means, he/she can bat again, only after every other player of the team gets out(ALL OUT).</li>
					<li>6 bonus runs will be awarded to the batsman hitting the ball in specified area (on straight). A POSTER will be used to define the scoring region.</li>
					<li>The batting team is allowed to take a "Hallabol Over", in which runs scored by the batting team will be doubled. At the same time, in this over the bowling team can dismiss the batsman by catching the ball on one bounce as well but in one hand. The decision of taking the "Hallabol Over" should be made before the start of the over. It’s compulsory for every team to take “Hallabol Over”. The batting team has to announce the HallaBol Over first and then the bowling may choose which bowler is going to bowl that particular over.</li>
					<li>All the normal international rules like, bye, leg bye, wide, no balls are ON.</li>
					<li>Only throw bowling will be allowed with speed restriction which will be looked after by the Umpire only.</li>
					<li>All the other rules are common and will be announced at the time of the match.</li>
					</div>
					
                <h3>Team Formation Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separate teams for girls and boys.</li>
                    <li>Team should comprise of players from minimum of 3 different batches.</li>
                    <li>MTech, Phd and Faculty will be considered different batches.</li>
					<li><b>Team composition for boys:</b> A team of 7 players can be formed, but only 6 players are actually involved in the game at any point of the match. So, while batting or bowling (& fielding), any 6 of the 7 players are chosen (So, the 7th player is like a Super Sub, who can bat/bowl/field). A team can have<b> maximum of 2 inter-IIT cricket players</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Team composition for girls:</b> A team of 6 players can be formed.</b>
